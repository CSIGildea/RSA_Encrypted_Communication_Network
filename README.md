</p>
Multiple clients can communicate to a server, through a gateway.  
The gateway in between (acting like a router) is unable to print the original content of the packets, as the original content has been encrypted.  
Meanwhile the server and client/s can decrypt their own messages using their own private keys. Meaning the communication between the server and any client is kept private, from snooping, whilst it is being transmitted across the network.

## Please See the Report for Further Project Details
P.S. Don't copy my code, by copying someone else's code you are only cheating yourself out of learning which is just going to make it harder come exam time or when employer's want to test your knowledge of this area.
